Vi PREFACE.

recognition, the present edition has been limited to nine .
of the “Lives,’' selected with special reference to their
>historical value. In the biographies of Miltiades, Themis-
tocleS‚ Cimon, and Alcibiades, we get glimpses of Athens
and Athenian life and spirit in the most interesting period
os the development of the state. In those of Pausanias
and Agesilau5‚ Nepos shows us something of the peculiar
Spartan government‚ and draws a contrast between the
characters of two of the most famous Spartan kingS. In
the story of Pelopidas and Epaminondas we discover how
it was that Thebes was enabled to secure a prominent
place among the peoples os Greece. Lastly the story of

Hannibal, dealing with his vow, his hatred os Rome, =

his marvelous ability as a general, the sear with which
he inspired the Romans, is preeminently worthy to be
included in any selection of representative lives from
N epOS.

The text is, with a few minor alterations, that of Halm3
the orthography is made unisorm with that of the other
books in this series. In response to many requests the
quantity of long vowels has been indicated throughout the
book. In determining quantitieS, and also in matters of
etymology, Lewis’ Elementary Dictionary has been for the
most part, though not invariably, followed.

The synonyms placed at the foot of each page of text, ,

and the word—groups printed just before the vocabulary‚
will, it is hoped, be of service in enlarging the pupil's
vocabulary and training him in his earliest reading to
cultivate the power of associating words of like origin.
