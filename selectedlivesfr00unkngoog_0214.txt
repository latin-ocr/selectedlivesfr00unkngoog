186 “ NOTES.

10. iterum consulem: this should read (Gracchum) bis con·
sulem and below Marcellum quintum consulem, for Gracchus was
killed after the expiration of his second, Marcellus during his
fifth consulship. 3

10. in Lucanis: join with sustulit5 see on per Ligures, p. 69,1. 6. ζ

10. absens ι i.e.‚ through his brother Mago. ¹

13. Longum est: it would be tedious, an expression of propriety ,
taking the indicative in Latin, but trans. as if the subjunct. ¹
(G. 311 e). ¹

14. ex quo: ut ex οδ. ,

15. quamdiu . . . posuit: he was not defeated in Italy (if ¹
we accept Nola). The rest of the statement is absurd. Ἴ

18. defensum: cf. deliberatum, p. 1, l. 10.

18. revocatus: 203. η

19. P. Scipionem : i.e., P. Cornelius Scipio, to which the l
agnomen Africanus was added after his defeat of Hannibal. He ³
conquered all Spain between 210 and 206. In 204 he went over ’
to Africa from Sicily and won a great battle near Utica, which =
occasioned the recall of Hannibal. ἶ

22. impraesentiarum: an adverb equivalent to in praesonuit, f
p. 8, 1. 6; a colloquial expression probably from in praesentii
rerum.

23. bellum componere ε cf. bellum compositurum, p. 37, l. 20. ζ

24. In conloquium convenit, etc. .· a conference is agreed up0n; Ῐ
on terms tlzey did not agree (lit. terms did not meet). 1

2 5. Post id factum ε aster this took place, lit. after this deed. ἶ

26. Zamam: this was southwest of Carthage. It is thought
that Naraggara, which lay fifty miles to the west of Zama, was
the scene of the battle ; the armies had encamped there prior to}
the colloquy. Hadrumetum was not over one hundred miles
from Zama, one hundred and fifty from Naraggara; hence the
statement trecenta milia is an exaggeration.

Paqe 71. ,abest ab Zama: ab is used even with names of³
towns when the distance from one place to another is stated.

8. acerrimss occupatus z most actively engaged.
