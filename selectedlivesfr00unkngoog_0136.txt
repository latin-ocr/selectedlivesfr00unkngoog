108 NOTES.

1. illos: i.e.‚ the ephors‚ subject of mittere, which has viros ζ
for obje'ct.

3. se: i.e.‚ Themistocles.

4. retinerent: in the. principal clause in indirect disc-ourse,

representing an imperative (G. 3393 H. 523, ΙΙΙ.).

4. Gestus ost ei ωδε t his suggestion was followed ,· more liter· Ἴ
ally‚ his way was done.

7. praedixit: warned them besorelzand; prae has its own force
in this compound, while dixit has horrowed some of the force of
insuit, and takes the construction of verbs of hidding, urg-ing.

7. ut ne: equivalent to ne alone, common in Cicero, rare else- ¹
where.

11. liberrime: with perfictfrankness.

12. quod . . . possent: we should not look for this clause till κ
after saepsisse, which, with the rest of the clause to which it be-
longs, serves as the antecedent ; perhaps it is brought in early to
disarm in part the wrath of the LacedaemonianS.

12. deos pi'lblicbs: the gods worshiped everywhere in Greece; ¹
Patrios those worshiped in Attica proper; penites, those of
each family. .

14. defendere: Themistocles cleverly words it as if the object
in building the walls were simply the defense of the gods; in οδε
refers to muros saepsisse3 supply quicquam before quod infitiless

16. ut: as.

16. oppositum: conforms in gender to the emphatic predicate
appositive propagnaculum, instead of to urbem.

17. apud quam iam bis: i.e.‚ through the battles of Marathon
and Salamis ; the expression is a figurative one with no especiai
reference to fighting on sea as opposed to fighting on land;
apud quam=et apud eam, hence the infinitive construction is
continued.

17. regiis: in narrating Greek history, rex and regius unquali-
fied‘are constantly used of the king of Persia and his concerns.

19. qui = cum ii, causal clause since they.
