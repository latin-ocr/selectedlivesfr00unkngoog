NOTES. 107

3. sibi . . . fore: they would have ,⁰ sibi, dat. of possession.

'4- quam infirmissimbs: as weak as possible ; quam with super·
lative signifies the highest degree possible. (G. 93, b; H. 170,
2 [2]); cs. finus maxims, p. 1, l. 3. ·

7. desierunt: from disin& the subject is Athenienses, which x

should be in the text.

10. ut (reliqui legati) exirent: depends on praecepit below.

10. tuendo: dat. of purpose, · satis alti tuendo. · luga enough
for defense.

12. opus facerent: these words continue his instructions and
depend on praecepit.

12. neque: for neve=et ne.

16. sacellis: a diminutive from sacrum (cf. eastellnm from
castrum), see group SAG-, SAc-; these were small enclosed bits
of ground consecrated to a divinity3 they contained an altar, but
were not roofed over.

16. csmstirent· of course not to be taken literally3 but even
then it implies an exaggeration of the statement of ThucydideS,
who says that the walls contained “ many columns too taken from
sepulchres.'' Consult Grote‚ Part 11, chap. xliv.

18. magistratfis: nominally two kings having a council of 28
old men called the Gerusia, stood at the head of the Spartan
state, but a board of five officers called Ephors, exercised over-
sight over everything, having power to accuse and arrest even the
kings. Naturally the Ephors are meant here.

18. quam longissime : see on quam infirmissimos, p. 14, l. 4.

20. conlegas} Aristides -and Abronichus.

23. miinitibnis: i.e., the fortification was nearly complete.

24. penes qubs: in whose hands. ’ ·

2 5. imperium: properly this means the comn'zand in war,
which was the prerogative of the kings and was seldom interfered
with by the ephors; hence unsuitable here. The proper word
would be potestas.

Pane 15. 1. quire aequum esse = ob eamque causam
aequum esse: this depends on contendit, and is parallel with esse

delita. 2
