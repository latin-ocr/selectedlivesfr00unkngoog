Paqe 66. 1. Hannibal, etc. .· qs. p. 9, l. 1, with note.

2. quod: ordinarily we find the abl. with ᾱό after dubit6;
neuter pronouns in the accus. form the only exceptionS.

3. ut . . . superarit: (for superaverit) a result clause where
an accus. and inf. would be more regular after verum est (G. 332 f ;
Η. 501, Ι, 2).

3. infitiandum: prej udiced Romans might easily do this ; later
several statues of Hannibal were set up at Rome.

4. ceteros: we should expect ceteris (dat.); see on omnes,
p. 47, l. 7. In one tale Hannibal is represented as claiming only
third place, putting Alexander the Great and Pyrrhus before
himself.

6. antecedat: this is subjunct. by attraction from its depen-
dence on the inf. praestitisse (G. 342 ; H. 529, II).

7. congressus est . . . discessit: sc. Hannibal for subject of
these. Hannibal did meet with one repulse at the hands of
Marcellus when he attacked Nola, a Campanian city, in 214.
This was a mere trifle compared with the long list of Hannibal’s
victories, but the Romans made a great deal of it.

8· Quod: therefore. Ὦ

9· domi: i.e., while Hannibal was in the field. He certainly
was n‘ot properly supported by his countrymen at home ; but the
fact that the Romans had a number of generals who were more
than a match for any Carthaginian leader other than Hannibal
had much to do with his failure.

1 1. virtutem: ability.
