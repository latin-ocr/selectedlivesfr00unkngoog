80 NOTES.

Pane 1. 1. Miltiades, Cimonis filius, Atheniensis: these j
words serve as a title, but are constructed with the first sentence.
In many of the “Lives” Nepos disconnects the first few words
from what follows and gives us a title in quite modern fashion.
Cf„ aga, the beginning of Themistocles, Alcibiades, Epaminondas.

1. Cimonis filius: a mistake on Nepos’ part, who confounds
the two men, uncle and nephew‚ bearing the same name. The
founder of the colony went to the Chersonesus some forty years
before the hero of Marathon, who was the son of Cimon. The
younger Miltiades succeeded his brother StesagoraS, who had
succeeded the elder Miltiades, their uncle. The following is the
genealogy: '

Cypselus'¹= the same wife ῗ Stesagoras I.

Miltiades Ι. Cimon Ι.
(the colonist). Ι
ὃῐεεειςιοταε ΙΙ. Miltiades II.

(the victor at Marathon).

the son of Zeus.
