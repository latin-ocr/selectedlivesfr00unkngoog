N OTES. 155

2. Diomedonte: abl. governed by the prep. coram, which some·
times follows its case.

3. Nihil: not at all ; an emphatic non: an adverbia] accus.

3. pecunii: abl. of separation following opus (G. 243 e, but
see also footnote; H. 414, IV).

4. gritfis: the abl. plural of gratia used adverbially; later
contracted into grifin, which has been adopted into English.

5. sin autem: autem strengthens the adversative force of sin.

6. Namque . . . ciritite: For I will not surrender (accipere,
lit. accept) my lovefor my country in exchangefor (pro) the wealtlt
os the world ,· this causes the object of the verb and the word
governed by pro to exchange places, but seems to express the
idea naturally.

7 Tu· placed first with scornful emphasis, a man like you.

8. incognitum. trans. by a relative clause.

8. tui. gen. dependent on similem (G. 234d [2]; H. 391, II.
4 [2])

9. egredere: (egredior) pres. imperative pass.; a deponent
verb occasions no confusion, but remember that in fully inflected
verbs the present infinitive act. and the present imperative pass
(sing.) have exactly the same form.

12. facis: the action is to be immediate (confestim), and is
not regarded as future though tradam stands in the apodosis3
by rule we should have feceris, which in English oddly enough
we regularly translate by the present. Cf. Cic. Verr. 4, 85:
moriere virgis (you shall be flogged to death) nisi mihi signum
traditur. ’

13. tuto: adv.

1 3. exiret: we should expect liceret sibi exire, as below liceret.

14- Istud: this which you ask ‚· this demonstrative pronoun is
regularly used in connection with the second person (G. 1o2c3
H. 450).

14. quidem: certainly.

15. neque tua causa: nevertheless not on your account.

15. tibi: the dat. of ind. obj. in place of the abl. οἱ separa·

tion (G. ²²93 H. 385, 2).
