In this comparison or balancing of his countrymen with

foreigners we should naturally look for some disparage-
ment of the latter. But everywhere in the portions of his
¹ work that have come down to ηε, we are forced to recog-
nize his fairness and impartiality. Even when a foreigner
j gains his glory at the expense of Romam, as was true of
Hannibal, Nepos shows the highest admiration for his
, exploits and in no way attempts to belittle his achieve-
ᾗ ments,
Ῑ We find many mistakes and inaccuracies in his historical
Ι statementS, but in view of the great task he undertook, of
his haste to finish the work begun· only late in life, and
of his being the first Roman historian to use foreign
. authoritieS‚ this need not excite our surprise.
