118 NOTES.

first period of his presence, as then he held command; every-

thing else he may and 'probably did continue.
14. locus: properly an appositive with Celonas, but it has been

attracted, as is usual in Latin, into the relative clause and agrees

with the relative.

15. cum . . . tum: not only . . . but also.
17. clavi: this has reference to cylindrical pieces of wood

possessed by the ephors, and carried by all generals on expedi-
tions. It was usual for the ephors to wind a narrow strip of
leather slantwise around the wooden cylinder, and then to write
short secret dispatches lengthwise upon the leather. When the
leather was unrolled, merely a series of single letters appeared,
having no consecutive meaning. The officer receiving it would
wind it about a precisely similar cylinder‚ thus learning its con-
tents. The cylinder and the message could each be called scytale,
of which clava staff is a literal translation ; in the present instance
the strip of leather written upon is meant, so use scytale in trans-
lating.

17. mfire illorum: perhaps referring to the scytale as just

seems a better interpretation. It also accords well with the
message following.

20. potentii: remember the distinction between this and
imperium.

20. instans: neuter; qualifies periculum.

22. licet: should be a past tense as in the time of Nepos
there were no longer kings at Sparta.

23. ebrum: i.e., Lacedaemoniorum.

23. regi: Pausanias was regent for Pleistarchus, the son of
Leonidas, and consequently e'njoyed a king’s rights.

26. quod . . . vocatur: this might have been qui . . . vocantur,
attracted to Hilotae; see on qui, p. 5, l. 6.

Paye 23. ῐ. Hilotae: slaveS, tillers of the soil for the
⁶ individual Spartans; probably they were descendants of those of
