MILTIADES.

Summa—Miltiades is sent to the Thracian Chersonesus

, to found a colony. On the way he touches at Lemn08‚ and is ’

made sport of by the Lemnians (1). He takes possession of the
ChersonesuS, and brings Lemnos under the power of Athens (2).
Left with others by Darius the Persian in charge of the bridge
over the Ister, while the king invades Scythia, he forms a plan

» for freeing the Greeks from Persian sway, but is thwarted by

Histiaeus (3). Darius makes war upon the Greeks. Miltiades
induces the Athenians to take the field against the Persians (4).
He defeats these in battle at Marathon, before the arrival of the
Lacedaemonians (5). His reward for the victory (6). He sails

' with a fleet to subdue the CycladeS, but returns with nothing

accomplished. Therefore he is condemned for treason, and dies
in prison (⁷). The true reason for his conviction and sen-
tence (8).
